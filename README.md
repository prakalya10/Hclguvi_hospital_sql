# Hclguvi_hospital_sql
SQL-based hospital analytics project built for Hackathon Carnival 2026. Designed a relational healthcare database to analyze admissions, resource utilization, billing, and patient outcomes using advanced SQL queries for data-driven hospital decision-making.
# Hospital Analytics System (SQL Project)

This project is an SQL-based healthcare analytics system developed for Hackathon Carnival 2026. It focuses on designing a relational hospital database and performing advanced SQL analysis to evaluate patient flow, resource utilization, billing efficiency, and clinical outcomes.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a structured hospital database and extract meaningful operational insights using SQL queries that support data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.

## 🗄 Database Design

The project uses a normalized relational schema consisting of:

- Patients – demographic and insurance details
- Admissions – hospital entry and discharge records
- Resources – ICU usage, ventilator usage, bed occupancy
- Staff – doctor workload and utilization tracking
- Billing – cost breakdown and insurance claims
- Outcomes – recovery status and readmission tracking

All tables are connected using primary and foreign key relationships to ensure referential integrity.

## 🛠 SQL Features Used

- Table creation with constraints
- Primary & foreign key relationships
- INNER JOIN across multiple tables
- Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- GROUP BY & ORDER BY analysis
- Date/time calculations
- Conditional logic using CASE
- KPI-driven analytical queries

## 📊 Key SQL Analytics

- Average Length of Stay (ALOS)
- Department-wise admission trends
- Bed and ICU utilization rates
- Readmission rate (30-day)
- Revenue by department
- Insurance claim distribution
- Doctor workload metrics
- Patient outcome analysis

## 🔍 Purpose of Analysis

The SQL queries simulate real hospital reporting systems and demonstrate how relational databases can support operational planning, financial monitoring, and clinical performance evaluation.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Stored procedures for automated reporting
- Index optimization for performance
- Predictive analytics integration
- Real-time hospital monitoring system
